&#8220;He stared out the window&#8230;for a while enjoying the spacey, empty feeling&#8230;then, suddenly&#8230;a little shiver went through him. It was Joanna&#8217;s face.&#8221; (p24-25)

I am stealing a term from The Familiar here, signiconic. We had talked previously about how an element or motif of a story might become both a sign and an icon— that is become both a condensed visual representation and a universal image or representation of a unified visual memory.

We talked in class Tuesday about the posibility the differences in time (&#8220;What does time feel like?&#8221;) in this novel — both analog time, a sort of deadened or &#8220;spacey&#8221; emptiness or pause, and digital time, which moves so quickly it seems &#8220;spacious, unbounded.&#8221; As we labored over his specific moment on page 25 where we see Ethan&#8217;s different experiences with each of these types of time, I wondered about what causes the abrupt shift. We get the dramatic satisfaction as readers from seeing that shift, of course (described for us as a &#8220;panic&#8221;), but that image of Joanna stick with me as a real-life GUI acting as a signicon— graphic being the image or memory, user being the narrator, and interface being the platform of experience (albeit life ultimately) and signicon in that we as a people understand the relevance of these images in our minds, our memories, to who we are.

For Ethan in this particilar moment, it is Joanna&#8217;s face. For Roberta in the first chapter, it is Sarah (her boyfriend&#8217;s ex that showed up at their doorstep a mess). As we go further into the novel, we find memory entangled on this analog vs. digital experience Ullman&#8217;s novel pushes for us. So, I guess what I&#8217;m really trying to posit is whether memory, specifically of relationships or hardships in those relationships, plays a role in these abrupt shifts in our narrators&#8217; experiences with analog time and digital time. In this novel, these narrators&#8217; experiences are asking of us the true relevance of identification— with analog experience or digital experience — by blurring the lines here between the digital and the analog.

What is human/analog memory? What is digital memory? How does memory FEEL different in each and for each?
