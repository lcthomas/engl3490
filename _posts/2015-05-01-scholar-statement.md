  - Final Project
---
For my final project I compared Blackboard to the Center for American Progress&#8217;s report entitled Disrupting College.  I wanted to cover another topic, but the mediums didn&#8217;t match what was required.  So, I settled for one of the suggested artifact pairs listed in the project instructions.  The despicable state our education system is in, which is only reinforced  by Clemson being ranked a top 20 public school, is a topic which I am passionate about, but also one that&#8217;s frustrating at the same time.  People just aren&#8217;t going to stop going to school as long as society requires a fancy embossed piece of paper to vouch for them; no matter how unnecessary or irrelevant it becomes.  It&#8217;s a shame as you pretty much already have to learn and research everything on your own, so why give away all your money for someone else to tell you to do it all yourself?  ISPs were cheaper than universities last time I checked.  Let me stop my rant before it starts again&#8230;

My project takes the form it does because a video, song, or blog about Blackboard would have been boring and/or inappropriate. Honestly, I couldn&#8217;t really think of any medium that would be meaningful to my argument except text and a picture or two; so that&#8217;s what I used.  I don&#8217;t believe a medium could actually be meaningful in any way to my argument, except for maybe if I had the ability to write it in Chinese and charge $100,000 for you to read it while a free copy in English resided elsewhere on the Internet.  But we both know that wasn&#8217;t going to happen.
