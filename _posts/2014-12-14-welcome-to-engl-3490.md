Glad you&#8217;re here! Together, we&#8217;re going to try to find out what &#8220;digital feelings&#8221; actually are.

Here&#8217;s how to set up an account on this site:

  1. Our course site is based on self-hosted installation of WordPress&#8217;s open source blogging software, WordPress.org. However, I have installed a plugin that allows you to sign into our site using your existing WordPress.com account that you used/created for <a href="https://thefamiliar.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">https://thefamiliar.wordpress.com/</a>. To sign in, go to our &#8220;Posts&#8221; page and click &#8220;Log in&#8221; under the &#8220;Meta&#8221; category in the right sidebar menu.
  2. You will see a screen that looks like this:

    To log in with your existing account, click &#8220;Log in with WordPress.com.&#8221; Once you do this, the system will automatically create an account for you on our site.
  3. Your role on the site will automatically default to &#8220;Subscriber,&#8221; which doesn&#8217;t allow you to post to the site. After your account has been created, I will change your role to &#8220;Author&#8221; so that you will be able to post to the site.

Here&#8217;s how to post to the site:

  1. To submit a post, you first need to be logged into the site. There are a couple of ways to do this. You can type this link into your browser and log in using your username and password: <a href="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl3490/wp-login.php" target="_blank">http://lindsaythomas.net/engl3490/wp-login.php</a>. You can also navigate to the site&#8217;s Posts page, click on  &#8220;Site Admin&#8221; under the &#8220;Meta&#8221; menu in the right sidebar, and then log in using your username and password. Logging in will take you to your Dashboard.
  2. Click on the &#8220;Posts&#8221; tab in the left menu, and click on the &#8220;Add New&#8221; submenu.
  3. Start filling in the blanks. Make sure to give your post a title. Enter your post content in the main post editing box below the title. **Make sure to give your post a category using the &#8220;Categories&#8221; menu on the right. Categorize your post according to what prompt you are responding to (so if you&#8217;re responding to Prompt 1, your category should be &#8220;Prompt 1,&#8221; and so on). I may miss your post if you fail to categorize it properly.**
  4. You can find more information on posting in the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_Posts" target="_blank">WordPress Codex</a>. You can also find articles in the Codex on incorporating media into your posts.
  5. When you&#8217;ve finished your post, click &#8220;Publish&#8221; under the &#8220;Publish&#8221; menu on the top right. You should then see your post appear in the site&#8217;s Posts page.
  6. If you need to edit your post after you&#8217;ve submitted it, just go to Posts > All Posts in the Dashboard, find your post, and choose &#8220;Edit&#8221; to be taken back to the editor.
