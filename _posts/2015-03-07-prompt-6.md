This prompt asks you to reflect on the methodology behind <a href="http://lindsaythomas.net/engl3490/investigation-2/" target="_blank">Investigation 2</a>. We&#8217;ve talked about what close reading is as a methodology in class, and last week&#8217;s prompt asked you to write a mini close reading of one passage from _Pattern Recognition_. For this week&#8217;s post, discuss how tracking the occurrences of one word throughout a text and then writing a &#8220;close reading&#8221; of the significance of that word differs from more traditional methods of close reading. How does &#8220;reading&#8221; a text in this way differ from how we usually read texts? What does &#8220;reading&#8221; mean in this context? How are the tools/technologies you need to complete Investigation 2 different from the tools/technologies you need to complete more traditional close readings, and why might these differences be important?
