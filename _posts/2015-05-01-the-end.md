For my final project, I was going to write a paper. However, being that this was a class about technology in the popular imagination, I formatted my paper on a blog.  I used Tumblr because my paper had a lot of quotes in it.  Tumblr lets you choose what type of post you want and there is a specific one for quotes.  It took me a few hours just to decide on what theme I wanted to use for my blog (I&#8217;m not kidding&#8230;a few hours.) I found a few I liked, but I settled on The Roller Theme because it flows really nicely as you scroll down.  I first typed out my paper on a Word document and then copied and pasted the different paragraphs into Tumblr, but it was in reverse chronological order.  Since The Roller Theme is parallax scroll, I wanted you to be able to read it as you scrolled down the page.

Another reason why I chose to use a blog format was because it goes along with the overall argument of my paper.  Digital media opens up new ways of interpretation. Like I previously mentioned, the format of Tumblr allowed me to use a different format for quotations.  The quotations are in a different font are the text is a little bit bigger.  I was also able to hyperlink WeFeelFine.org. You could try and click the hyperlink on a printed out piece of paper, but I don&#8217;t think anything would happen&#8230;.

I found my paper a lot more interesting in digital form rather than print.  It was just more fun to read.  Also, my Tumblr is not on private, so I&#8217;m curious to see if anyone will comment or follow it.  Publishing a book can take years, but publishing my Tumblr was just a click of a button.

In all honestly, I had a very difficult time meeting the word requirement.  I&#8217;m not sure if it was because of the way I wanted to present it on a blog, or if it was because my artifacts were lacking in evidence.

This was a really unique assignment and I had never had to do anything like it.  It sounded overwhelming at first, but it was actually really cool.  I would have never imagined using a book like Pattern Recognition and website like WeFeelFine.org to make the same argument, but then again, I never imaged writing my final assignment on Tumblr.
