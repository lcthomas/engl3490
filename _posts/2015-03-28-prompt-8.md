This week&#8217;s prompt has two parts:

1) Describe, in your own words, what McPherson&#8217;s main argument is in &#8220;US Operating Systems at Mid-Century: The Intertwining of Race and UNIX&#8221; (assigned for Thursday&#8217;s class). Spend no more than one paragraph describing this argument.

2) In the rest of the post, connect McPherson&#8217;s argument to _The Bug._ You can do this however you like. You might pick out one specific passage or scene from _The Bug_ to discuss in connection to McPherson&#8217;s piece; you might discuss the relationship between McPherson&#8217;s piece, Ensmenger&#8217;s piece, and _The Bug;_ or you might choose some other method of comparison/connection. The main question you should focus on answering for this part of the prompt is this: If _The Bug_ isn&#8217;t explicitly about race, why are we reading McPherson&#8217;s piece in connection with this novel?
