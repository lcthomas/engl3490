This week&#8217;s prompt is similar to last week&#8217;s in that you are free to write about whatever you wish related to Tuesday&#8217;s reading (Chapters 1-19 of _Pattern Recognition_). However, there is one constraint. Your response should center on **one specific passage** from _Pattern Recognition_. You should begin your post by quoting that passage (and providing its page number), and then you should spend the rest of your post doing a close reading of that passage. Why is this passage important or interesting? How does it connect to one of the novel&#8217;s themes? What does this passage mean? In other words, I am looking for you to do a mini literary analysis of your chosen passage.
