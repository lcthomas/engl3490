In &#8220;Stuplimity: Shock and Boredom in Twentieth-Century Aesthetics,&#8221; Sianne Ngai describes stuplimity like this:

Stuplimity is &#8220;a syncretism of boredom and astonishment, of what &#8216;dulls&#8217; with what &#8216;irritates&#8217; or agitates, of excessive excitation with extreme desensitization or fatigue&#8221; (par 16).

What does stuplimity mean? How might we describe this feeling?
