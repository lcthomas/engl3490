After reading Bosquet&#8217;s article and reading a few other posts about the informalization and of colleges, the raising prices of tuition, and the massive number of college graduates without jobs even those with practical degrees and there must be a reason for these culmination of events. Colleges have obviously tried to make having a degree, specifically their degree in a certain field, an essential piece of life. Who wouldn&#8217;t market their own product? But over the years, spanning after my parents college days to now the number of college students has soared and plenty of them have ended up with the same job they would have had they not attended college. Real question is why is this happening? I believe that through society&#8217;s raising of college&#8217;s importance and stressing its career implications has caused the average intellectual person to pressure themselves into college even though they could never afford the degree or all the fees that come with it anyways. Maybe the abundance of colleges and the emergence of these new online colleges has in fact lowered the standards, effects, and ultimately the usefulness of a college degree. These universities got greedy by raising prices, accepting more and more students, creating and offering so many new majors and programs and now they&#8217;re so accessible and easily attempted that anyone will try it including people that should never go to college. This isn&#8217;t about whether you could afford it or not, honestly that has been more of the problem. People that can afford college going, never really contributing much but more so taking away those who would produce and excel&#8217;s chances away from them. College&#8217;s are filled with people who expect to complete a packet and find a job offer on the last page. Universities should be more selective and try to accurately place students into useful fields based on their skill sets rather than just trying to pump out degrees. Universities are starting to become either babysitting firms that watch over parties and activities or they are generic, useless online degree factories. Bosquet talks about how so many university faculty are so worried about how online colleges will take over teachers jobs and think that the worker will be replaced but if they continue at this rate the university in general might as well be. The threat of teachers losing jobs will always be a real one, but if these universities were going to go fully online it would have already happened by now because the capability is certainly there. The focus of universities should rest more on simplifying and purifying the college experience academically. Get back to basics and really teach the students through more professor-to-student interaction and simply incorporate these new digital nuances into the curriculum but the teacher can never be replaced, it needs to be strengthened because they are losing their own value by turning over to the online universities. In the future maybe the online universities will prepare and ween out those who simply seek a degree and job that may or may not come with it and then these refined universities will actually teach. I somewhat agree with Newfield&#8217;s (discussed in Tuesday&#8217;s class) elitist type few that colleges should be more for the elite intellects rather than the elite financially. I&#8217;m agreeing with Newfield&#8217;s point that colleges should focus more on merit and knowledge than dollars and cents.
