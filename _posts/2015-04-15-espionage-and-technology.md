I am bouncing a few ideas for my final project. I definitely want to use Pattern Recognition for my main artifact. I am playing with the idea of using the way technology is used to aid Dorothea&#8217;s investigation and comparing it to the way big companies use our information to target us as consumers. I will argue that they are both essentially espionage. I will use a few of the readings we have been using in class recently and I may try to find some others as well.  I may try to do a video/animation to accompany it.

I originally thought about using the the website in Pattern Recognition and comparing it to a real conspiracy site but that I couldn&#8217;t think of an argument to go with it. I also couldn&#8217;t think of how I wanted to make it multimodal. However, as I am thinking about my new idea with the espionage argument, I think I can incorporate the website and a real life conspiracy site into my argument. I can maybe use it as a post from the real site and a post from the novel and then hypothesize how the real site post could be used to how Dorothea uses the posts in the novel to spy.
