Class on Tuesday was a very interesting experience for me! Distraction and confusions is very real when it comes to social media and the internet. While I like to think of myself as being a multi-tasker, this &#8220;talent&#8221; can really only go so far.

I really enjoyed the chatroom aspect of our experiment, and I was easily overwhelmed with all of our emails. Chatrooms can definitely provide instant gratification and breaks down the barriers of taking time to communicate with others. I really started to feel overwhelmed with our chatroom once I started checking my email and tweeting, though. On top of following all of these forms of communication, I decided to take several Buzzfeed quizzes. They are really entertaining! While taking these quizzes, I experienced a new feeling&#8211;FOMO (fear of missing out). Social media is a constant outlet to update others on life events, feelings, etc., and it is easy to feel like you could be missing something if you do not stay up to date. I don&#8217;t think these feelings are healthy, and I&#8217;m jealous of generations before us (who did not have social media) who never had to experience these emotions. As I would be taking these online quizzes, I could see the number of messages in my browser adding up, which made me feel like I was missing out on something funny or important happening.

By the end of class, I had a headache. I did not feel like listening to music on my bus home, and I did not want to text any of my friends/check social media. It&#8217;s amazing how our generation has become so addicted to something that can be so poisonous to our lives. I don&#8217;t say that to just bash everyone around me&#8211;I have the same problem as well! While I know that social media and other forms of media online do have amazing benefits to our society and the way the world works, Tuesday&#8217;s assignment made me realize just how toxic they can be to our communication skills and learning processes.

Hayles&#8217; piece from our reading list really seemed to stick out to me, and I think her decision to discuss AD/HD was great. She writes, &#8220;But genetic predispositions often express themselves with varying degrees depending on their interaction with environmental factors, so the role played by increased environmental stimulation remains unclear&#8221; (191). My sister has severe ADD, so I have been exposed to someone who truly experiences these factors in her life. After Tuesday&#8217;s class, I would definitely argue that environment plays a role in the power of AD/HD in individuals&#8217; lives. While Hayles cannot confirm that these two are linked, I think she is touching on a really important point of how AD/HD affects people in today&#8217;s media-distracted world.
