Blogs came into being with the intention of allowing another form of self-expression online that was available and accessible to many more individuals than a traditional book or print editorial would be capable of reaching. Because of the original purpose of sharing emotions and thoughts, a blog served as a perfect medium for a final project that is trying to make an argument about the superiority of digital modes of communication to convey human feelings and musings. The instant appearance of a blog on the internet serves as a parallel between the way humans share their feelings because there is no lag time or limitations on how much or how quickly they can share their thoughts. My final project can be found on a wordpress site as an extended blog that mainly is just an academic paper with an additional case study that features pictures and graphs so as to complete the multimodal requirement. While the words are the most essential part of a tweet, their presentation is also important because the visual quality allows for a stronger comparison between new forms of technology and traditional print modes that are insufficient in terms of completely expressing the complexity and multitudes of human emotion.

I posted my project online in an extended blog post format to augment the argument I make in my final project that digital modes of communication are superior forms of self-expression when compared with print mediums due to their unbounded nature. By posting my project as a blog, the argument can be critiqued, commended, or anything else by anyone who wants to comment on it and say something, and is not limited by any physical bounds. The human mind processes information and emotions analogically so a blog post that allows for instantaneous comments, or revisions is a more applicable remediation of the human brain than a physical print paper would be. The unlimited and global nature of digital modes of media is something I wanted to draw attention to in my final project and by posting it online Iâ€™m supporting my assertion that digital modes of communication are superior to print modes because of their lack of restrictions and wider applicability and accessibility.

By posting the information about Pattern Recognition as a print source within a more traditional paper style and then presenting the case study about Katy Perry accompanied with screenshots of example tweets and graphs, the differences between the two modes of communication are further highlighted. The tweets are presented in their original visual form and accompanied by short explanations underneath each to keep in style with the digital and fragmented nature of the mode of Twitter. By using graphs and the screenshots of tweets, the multi-dimensional nature of digital modes of communication is further exemplified by using other forms of media besides just words which are used in the section of the blog that discusses Pattern Recognition.
