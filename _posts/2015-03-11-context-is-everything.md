I&#8217;ll be one of the first to admit that I was a tad nervous when first hearing about Investigation 2; what I&#8217;ve since dubbed, a &#8220;hyper-close reading&#8221; assignment.  My brain immediately began analyzing the implications of this unorthodox task.  One word into over _twelve-hundred_ words?  Yikes!  The extreme unbalance of those two numbers triggered my brain&#8217;s &#8220;for real!?&#8221; response.  This was most likely due to the fact that I haven&#8217;t performed many close readings before, except for the occasional close reading of a line or stanza from a poem.  I&#8217;ve always been encouraged to read carefully in order to recognize patterns and to better understand the message being offered by an author, but never have I been asked to examine such a small piece of text over such a relatively large area.  This obsessiveness of the minute and mundane reminds me of a reoccurring theme in the 90&#8217;s television show, _Seinfeld_.  And in case you were wondering, I wasn&#8217;t that strange of a kid in the 90&#8217;s, my parents were just in control of the television remote during Seinfeld&#8217;s on-air existence.  Although, I have to say that I do now weirdly enjoy it for the nostalgia it brings me.

&nbsp;



(Above is a short clip from the 90&#8217;s television show, _Seinfeld_, in which one of the show&#8217;s main characters, Jerry, carefully analyzes the emphasis that&#8217;s placed on particular words of a comment in an attempt to better understand the context in which the comment was uttered)

&nbsp;

After the initial shock, I realized later that Investigation 2 wasn&#8217;t that &#8220;out-of-the-box&#8221; after all.  At first, I was a bit skeptical about the assignment&#8217;s relevance.  However, I can now certainly see its usefulness as an exercise in critical thinking. The reason being is that, it causes one to analyze a reading in a way that doesn&#8217;t allow conclusions to be drawn directly from what the text literally says.  Instead, one must think critically about the author&#8217;s thought process, reasoning, positions, and motives.  In other words, context becomes everything.  The reason for the plot becomes as important, if not _more_ important, than the plot itself.  I think diving into an assignment of this kind is much less intimidating with that kept in mind.
