For my final project, I wanted to do a comparative analysis on social networks in _The Familiar _and the real life, popular social network Tumblr.

I was thinking of doing my whole project on Tumblr because of much you are able to do on that site, rather than on Facebook and Twitter. With Tumblr, I would be able to post photos, quotes, and text posts. It&#8217;s a form of a blog that I think would be more creative than just writing a basic paper. In using tumblr, I might be able to use a photo or quote to get one of my points across. I could use a text post to write a more in depth analysis if I think that a photo or quote won&#8217;t suffice. There are multiple possibilities that using Tumblr would allow me to do.

For my argument, I wanted to compare the social network, such as the Horrorsphere with Tumblr. To set up this argument, I wanted to talk about how there is social media out there that can be used as a form of expression, but can end up as a way of exposing others. With the Horrorsphere, it was clear that its name stayed true to the content that ended up on the website. It was filled with a lot of negativity. However, there are other ways to express yourself via social media where you do not have to make fun of others and put them in a &#8220;horror&#8221; type view for others to see. On Tumblr, it is used for a lot of different reasons. There are fashion Tumblrs who reblog outfis and designers. There are Tumblrs that are just there for humor. There are also Tumblrs that make fun of others, in a way that the Horrorsphere does (but not to that extent). However, Tumblr is a way to get inside of someone&#8217;s mind. That&#8217;s why most, including me, keep their Tumblrs private. So, I would want part of my argument to be &#8220;why are we so quick to post negativity about others ( like in the Horrorsphere), but are hesitant to show everyone what you are interested in, how you feel, etc. Forming that into an argument, rather than a question, is kind of where I am stuck. How do I argue that people are more willing to post, or look at, negativity more than their true selves, using Xanther and myself as an example.
