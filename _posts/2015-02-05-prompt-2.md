Choose one browser to use for Tuesday’s class, and keep track of your browsing history during class (so make sure this history is enabled &#8212; it is enabled by default in most browsers). After class, use this history to retrace your steps during class and to reflect on your experience of class on Tuesday. What was our class experiment in “wasting time on the internet” like for you, and why? Did you feel distracted? Bored? Energized? Engaged? Disengaged? How does your browsing history show this (or perhaps it doesn&#8217;t)? Refer to/incorporate at least one of Tuesday’s readings into your response.

Prompt 2 is due by 10 pm on Wednesday, February 11.
