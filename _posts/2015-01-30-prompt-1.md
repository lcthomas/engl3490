Chapter 5 from Matthew Kirschenbaum’s book _Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination _(reading due for class on Thursday, February 5) describes the term “transformission.” What does this concept mean, and how does it differ from “transmission” and “transformation?” If it helps to illustrate your points, you might discuss a specific aspect of _Agrippa_ as it relates to this concept.

Blogs on this prompt are due by 10 pm on Wednesday, February 4.
