This week&#8217;s prompt is an open prompt. You may write about whatever you want from the reading for EITHER Tuesday&#8217;s OR Thursday&#8217;s class. As described in the [blogging guidelines](http://lindsaythomas.net/engl3490/blogging-guidelines/ "Blogging Guidelines"), there are a number of ways to approach this kind of prompt. You can situate the reading among the other readings we’ve encountered in class; you can write about an aspect of the day’s reading that you don’t understand, or something that jars you; or you can formulate an insightful question or two about the reading and then attempt to answer your own questions. As always, your response should be thoughtful, nuanced, and specific, and you focus on analysis rather than description or summary.
