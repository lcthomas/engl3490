I chose to look at my Twitter archive since I tend to tweet more than browsing through Facebook.

With the Twitter archive, you are able to look at your tweets month by month and it shows them in a type of bar graph so you are able to see which month or year that you tweeted the most/least. My tweets go all the way to 2009, when I first created my Twitter account. I was the least active on Twitter during the first few years, with my tweets ranging from around 300-500 per month. For the past year or so, my tweets have rapidly increased ranging from 800-1,000 tweets per month. These results do not really surprise me because over the past few years, I have taken to social media a lot more to express myself. Back in high school, I would get nervous that people from high school would find my twitter so I would always hold back my thoughts. Now, I am past the judgement stage and will tweet just about anything. I like that the archives show you every tweet on a month to month basis because sometimes you want to look back and find a specific tweet or just reminisce.

The implications with these tweets is thatÂ **anyone** can find them (at least when your tweets are set to public and not private). They can easily google your twitter name and the results will come up with various tweets. I also find it a bit easier to find people through Twitter, rather than Facebook. The use of hashtags has also made it easier to find tweets. This brings me to Foreman&#8217;s article where he states, &#8220;The whole movement is not dissimilar to phrenology and biological determinism, only instead of feeling your skull to predict who you are as a person, a company may now read your data.&#8221; It&#8217;s highly likely that once you go out to the professional world, they will want to look up your social media sights to see how you are as a person, whether that be with Facebook or Twitter. Since tweets are not meant to be lengthy and most people do not use Twitter to share multiple amounts of photos or video links, these professionals are only seeing a glimpse of who you are. I certainly am a lot more outgoing through Twitter than I am in person, but that does not necessarily mean I am one or the other. I mostly use Twitter to make jokes or tweet celebrities and it is kind of scary to think that a professional company may be reading those.

Foreman&#8217;s article mentioned the Disney Magic Bands and since I am going there next month (I recently just received my Magic Bands in the mail), I thought I would make my media post about them. I think that while some data tracking can be seen as bad, Disney&#8217;s tracking is actually useful and you can do a lot with it, especially when it can be used for Mickey starting a conversation about a ride you were just on (like the article described)
